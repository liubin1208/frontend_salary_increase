      The glass candle is meant to represent truth and learning, rare and
      beautiful and fragile things. It is made in the shape of a candle to
      remind us that a maester must cast light wherever he serves, and it is
      sharp to remind us that knowledge can be dangerous.
      <span class="highlight">
        Wise men may grow arrogant in their wisdom, but a maester must always
        remain humble.
      </span>
      The glass candle reminds us of that as well. Even after he has said his
      vow and donned his chain and gone forth to serve, a maester will think
      back on the darkness of his vigil and remember how nothing that he did
      could make the candle burn . . . for even with knowledge, some things are
      not possible. ——「Song of Ice And Fire」
